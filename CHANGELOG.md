# Changelog

All notable changes to Kaeso are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-16

The first release of Kaeso, the open-source AI gateway you run yourself: the gateway, KPP, the console, the UI library and the documentation, from one repository under one version.

### Added

#### Model API

- OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible endpoints under `/v1`: `chat/completions`, `responses` and `responses/input_tokens`, `embeddings`, `messages` and `messages/count_tokens`, and `models` in both formats, with streaming. Every request is translated through KPP, so any supported format reaches any model in the project's catalogue.
- OpenAI and Anthropic as providers, OpenAI through Responses by default; one pooled HTTP client per provider with rustls, HTTP/2 and proxy support; connect, total, first-byte and idle timeouts with per-model overrides; cancellation of the provider request when the app goes away.
- Errors in the app's own format, no retries and no passthrough; `kaeso-request-id`, `kaeso-model` and `kaeso-provider` headers on every response.
- Keepalive frames on long streams, readable reasoning across formats, and reasoning kept between tool calls for OpenAI Chat apps on other providers.
- Usage for streams that end early, estimated and marked as such, and honest outcomes for streams that fail after their headers were sent.

#### Catalogue, keys and limits

- A per-project model catalogue filled from a shipped [models.dev](https://models.dev) snapshot, synced every 24 hours, with overrides, custom models, bulk adds and aliases.
- Provider keys owned by the organization: several per provider, one default, assignment to projects, envelope encryption with AES-256-GCM under a rotatable master key ring, write-only.
- API keys per project for members and service accounts, with expiry, inference and platform access, disabling and archiving; organization platform keys; expiry warnings.
- Model access and limits on projects, members and keys: request and token rates, token and spend budgets per day, month or in total, hard or soft, with alerts.
- Costs at the prices of request time; usage by day, week, month, model, key, member and project.

#### Request logs

- One metadata row per model request and, when allowed, the request and the full reply in ClickHouse, batched and bounded; retention per organization; search, export as JSON Lines or CSV, deletion by time range and a storage overview.

#### Platform API

- Everything the console does, under `/platform/v1`, described by a generated [OpenAPI document](https://github.com/logicplanes/kaeso/blob/dev/openapi.json): organizations, members, invitations, projects, service accounts, keys, provider keys, models, limits, usage, logs, the audit log, security settings and instance administration.
- Fine-grained rights with built-in and custom roles ([rights](https://docs.kaeso.app/concepts/rights)); every endpoint checks exactly one right, and every change is audited.
- Streamed Playground requests to a project's models as the signed-in member.

#### Accounts and sign-in

- First-start setup, email and password with TOTP and recovery codes, sign-in links, password resets, single sign-on through each organization's OIDC provider, and sign-up by instance setting with allowed email domains.
- HttpOnly session cookies, session lists, recent sign-in for sensitive actions, required two-factor authentication and single sign-on per organization, and throttled sign-in attempts.
- Pictures of people, organizations and projects; the user's own account, language and notifications.
- Instance administration: users, organizations, settings, system status and the instance audit log; organization deletion with a grace period during which the organization stays readable.
- Emails for every account, security, organization and alert event, in English, German and Simplified Chinese.

#### Console

- The web console for a Kaeso install, built with React 19, TanStack Router and Query only from `@logicplanes/kaeso-ui` and a client generated from the Platform API document.
- First-run setup, sign-in with a password, a sign-in link, an authenticator code or single sign-on, sign-up where the install allows it, password resets and invitations.
- The project overview: requests, tokens, cost and errors over a period, charts by day, week or month, a breakdown by model, key or member, limits and recent errors.
- API keys with expiry, access, models and limits and their one-time reveal; the model catalogue with capabilities, prices, aliases and overrides; members, service accounts and roles with their rights; limits and budgets at every level.
- Request logs in a dense table with filters, a live mode, an inspector for each request and its content, and exports as JSON Lines or CSV.
- The Playground: one prompt to several models side by side, streamed, with their parameters.
- Settings for the account (profile, password, two-factor authentication, sessions, language, appearance), the organization (members, invitations, security and single sign-on, provider keys, projects, deletion and restore) and the instance (users, organizations, accounts and retention).
- The command palette and keyboard shortcuts throughout, and a toast while the gateway can't be reached.
- Every word in English, German and Simplified Chinese, following the account's language or the browser's; light and dark themes; phone and desktop layouts; keyboard paths and accessible names for every control.

#### KPP

- `kaeso-kpp` on crates.io: canonical, stateless types for generation, token counting, embeddings and model listings, with messages of ordered blocks, tools, output formats, reasoning and sampling settings, usage with the provider's raw usage, and `KppError`; stream events with one block lifecycle; model listings paged the same way for every format; origin-bound `Extras`, raw unknown blocks and opaque reasoning, so data KPP does not model is kept and replayed only to its own format; `validate()` and `required_capabilities()`; a public API that can grow without breaking callers.
- `kaeso-codecs` on crates.io: sans-IO codecs for Anthropic Messages (with token counting), OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses (with input token counting) and OpenAI Embeddings, covering requests, responses, server-sent event streams, errors and model listings.
- Lossless same-format round trips for every fixture, including exact spellings of `null`, defaults and stream chunking.
- `check()` refuses everything a target cannot express with an `Unsupported` error that names the feature, before anything is sent; errors for coding tools' pre-release fields say which setting to change.
- Cross-format rules: a scoped allowlist of fields that may be dropped, origin-bound file ids and reasoning, reasoning settings mapped by a fixed effort and budget table, and reasoning that travels with the conversation and comes back to its provider unchanged.
- `dispatch` selects every codec function by format at run time; `sse` parses and writes event streams incrementally; `testing` compares JSON and event streams structurally for round-trip tests in other crates.

#### UI library

- `@logicplanes/kaeso-tokens` on npm: every design value of Kaeso, from the pure white and pure black canvases, a tint-free grey ramp, status and chart colours and the type scale to sizes, radii, elevation, control material and motion; as CSS variables, a Tailwind CSS v4 theme in which only token values exist, TypeScript constants and JSON; with contrast tested for every text role, status colour and chart colour in both modes.
- `@logicplanes/kaeso-ui` on npm: 73 component entry points on Base UI and Tailwind CSS v4, from the app frame, sidebar, buttons and inputs to menus, dialogs, tables, settings groups, code blocks, Markdown and a command palette; charts drawn as React SVG; Kaeso's own composites for models, providers, keys, status codes and the Playground.
- `@logicplanes/kaeso-ui/i18n` with every library text in English, German and Simplified Chinese, `@logicplanes/kaeso-ui/format` for numbers, money, tokens and dates, and `@logicplanes/kaeso-ui/theme` for light, dark and system themes without a flash on load.
- Inter and Geist Mono included, one entry point per component, and rules for coding agents shipped in the package: `AGENTS.md`, the design foundations and a generated registry of every component, prop and variant.
- The showcase at [ui.kaeso.app](https://ui.kaeso.app): every component with a live demo and its props, in light and dark and in three languages.

#### Documentation

- [docs.kaeso.app](https://docs.kaeso.app) in English, German and Simplified Chinese: getting started, self-hosting, the console, the model API, the Platform API and errors, concepts such as the request flow, format translation and rights, and development of Kaeso itself.
- Pages are Markdown files with links between files checked at build time, GitHub's heading anchors and alerts, images from the pages' own folder, raw HTML kept as text, and only http, https and mailto links out.
- Search with ⌘K or Ctrl+K, the console's frame and themes, an HTML file per page and language with canonical addresses and alternates, a 404 page per language and a sitemap, for any static host.
- Bundle budgets of 216 kB for the frame and 24 kB for each page's content.

#### Self-hosting

- One binary, `kaeso`: `serve`, `migrate`, `master-key generate` and `rewrap`, `setup-link`, `user reset-2fa`, `healthcheck` and `openapi`.
- Configuration through `KAESO_*` variables or a TOML file, with secrets from files, validated at startup ([configuration](https://docs.kaeso.app/self-hosting/configuration)).
- Forward-only PostgreSQL and ClickHouse migrations at startup under a lock.
- `/healthz`, `/readyz`, Prometheus metrics on a separate port and structured JSON logs.
- Distroless, non-root images `ghcr.io/logicplanes/kaeso-gateway` and `ghcr.io/logicplanes/kaeso-console` (the console served by Caddy with a strict content security policy) for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, with provenance.
- A one-file Docker Compose package with Caddy, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse and Valkey, attached to every release ([self-hosting](https://docs.kaeso.app/self-hosting)).

#### Quality

- Unit and integration tests against real PostgreSQL, ClickHouse and Valkey, with line coverage gates for the gateway and KPP and coverage thresholds for every TypeScript package.
- The official `openai` and `anthropic` Python SDKs against KPP's encoders, against the gateway with a mock provider built from KPP's fixtures, and against a fresh install of the Compose package.
- A fixture corpus with provenance for every format, a cross-format golden matrix, property tests, fuzz targets for every decoder and benchmarks.
- Playwright suites for the console against a stack of its own, the documentation site and the showcase, with accessibility checks in both themes.
- Dependency audits, MIT-compatible licences checked for every dependency and every shipped bundle, and a check that the code has no comments.
