# Model data

Data shipped with every gateway release, and where it comes from. [Model data](https://docs.kaeso.app/development/architecture/gateway#model-data) explains what each file holds and how the gateway uses it.

## `kpmr.json`

A snapshot of the catalogue of [KPMR](https://kpmr.kaeso.app), the Kaeso Provider & Model Registry, in format 1, for the providers Kaeso calls; its `provider_ids` list every provider KPMR knows. KPMR builds the catalogue from [models.dev](https://models.dev), the open (MIT-licensed) model database, and applies its reviewed registry: corrections, added and removed models, and what only Kaeso needs, such as adaptive thinking, forced tool choice, effort levels, the one-hour cache write price and the dialect Kaeso sends. Every registry entry cites its sources on the model's page at [kpmr.kaeso.app](https://kpmr.kaeso.app).
